### About Me

Hi, I'm Rebecca, I've just completed an industry led programming bootcamp with Northcoders. I've learnt in Javascript how to build a back-end framework, and then link this to the front-end. I have experience creating API's with Express and building a programme using React. I can format a project using CSS, Bootstrap or Tailwind. I am also comfortable using Firebase, their Firestore, Storage & User Authentication, combined with using React Native and Expo to create a mobile app.

I have loved developing my problem solving skills, Northcoders has equipped me with the confidence in my ability to learn new skills in a short period of time. I am looking forward to applying this in the workplace!
